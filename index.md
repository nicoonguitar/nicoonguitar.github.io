I’m a software engineer, focusing on IoT product development.

I started my iOS development career at Elun, a Chilean mobile app factory, working on various projects using GPS and iBeacon technologies. Three years later, I led the iOS teams at TheBesty - today [KeyoCoin](https://keyopass.com) -, an Chilean-American app for travelers with tour booking and real-time chat with the hotel concierge, and later [Velco](https://velco.bike), building French IoT products for smart mobility and vehicle tracking systems.

Today, I'm currently part of the iOS team at [Netatmo](https://www.netatmo.com).
